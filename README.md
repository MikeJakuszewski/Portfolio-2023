This project was built using HTML, CSS, SCSS, and JavaScript. I utilized media queries to ensure that the website is responsive and accessible across all devices.

## Optimizations

- Adding accessibilty features to darken the text for visual aids.
- Implementing dark mode
- I wanted to add gif visuals for each project; however, the load time increased drastically, so I had to remove them.

## Lessons Learned:

- Learned how to connect forms
- Working with media queries
- How to resolve caching issues by using file versioning
